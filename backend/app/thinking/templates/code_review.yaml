  When reviewing code, systematically check:
  1. Security: Look for injection points, auth bypass, data exposure
  2. Performance: Identify N+1 queries, unnecessary loops, memory leaks
  3. Maintainability: Check naming, structure, documentation
  4. Edge cases: Consider null, empty, boundary conditions
